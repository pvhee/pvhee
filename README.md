### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter. I'm a lead engineer at [Cutover](https://www.cutover.com/), an exciting work automation platform used by some of the largest organisations on the planet. I'm also the founder and advisory CTO of [Marzee](https://marzee.co/), a well-known web agency specialising in Jamstack & serverless technologies, [ex-head of technology at Comic Relief](https://medium.com/comic-relief), one of UK's most loved charities. I recently founded [We Are Serverless](http://weareserverless.com), a boutique consultancy firm which (amongst other things) runs RTE's Toy Show Appeal donation tech every year. I thrive on building and leading diverse teams through a combination of empathic leadership and technical skills. 

I'm interested in all things web, technology and product, through agile engineering practices, serverless and cloud-native technologies and continuous integration and development.
