### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter. I'm a lead engineer at [Cutover](https://www.cutover.com/), an exciting work automation platform used by some of the largest organisations on the planet. I'm also the founder of [Marzee Labs](https://marzeelabs.org/), a well-known web agency specialising in Jamstack & serverless technologies, [ex-head of technology at Comic Relief](https://medium.com/comic-relief), one of UK's most loved charities, and an independent consultant. I love building and leading diverse teams through a combination of empathic and technical leadership, combined with clear communication skills. 

I'm interested in all things web/technology/product, with a focus on serverless, cloud-based development (AWS) and CI/CD.
